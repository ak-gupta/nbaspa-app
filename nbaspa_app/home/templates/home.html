                    Player impact metrics are supposed to help us understand one thing: how much
                    does a player impact winning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To answer this question, we used play-by-play data to quantify the impact of
                    any given play in terms of how it changes the probability of a team winning the
                    game. We won't go into detail here
                    (<a href="https://nbaspa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_spa/definition.html">this documentation</a>
                    has all the information you need), but we'll lay out the major benefits and
                    limitationsof our impact metric.
                </p>
                <blockquote>The metric is <em>highly contextual</em>.</blockquote>
                <p>
                    The metric <em>can</em> capture the effects of out-of-game factors like team
                    quality and fatigue as well as the time and score of the game. While some might
                    view this as a limitation, we think that contextual information can provide us
                    with more information about the impact that a player is adding beyond the
                    baseline expectation for the team. However, we've added toggles in the player
                    comparison visualizations to remove the context where desired.

                    Especially defense. Rotations, ball denial, and point-of-attack defense are
                    great examples of impactful plays you won't find on traditional boxscores or
                    in eventlogs. We would love to attribute credit to players for contesting shots,
                    but that information is not available to us on a play-by-play basis
                    (see <a href="https://nbaspa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#pulling-data-from-the-nba-api">here</a>
                    if you want to know more about our underlying data).
